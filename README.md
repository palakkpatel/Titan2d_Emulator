# Titan2d Emulator for Max Flow Height Mapping using CNN

The __Titan2d Emulator__ is a project aimed at emulating the Titan2d simulation to create a map of maximum flow height using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This repository provides code to train and use the Max Height Model, which takes simulation parameters as input and generates a 2D grid representing the predicted maximum flow height distribution.
